# Teaching
I've been a teacher at Leiden University since 2017 and have taught a variety of first year Psychology courses. I love teaching, not only beause it's an opportunity for me to talk about stuff that interests me profoundly, but because a student exclaiming: "Oh wait, now I get it!" is a profoundly rewarding experience.
