# About me

I'm an almost graduated master student in Cognitive Neuroscience at Leiden University with a passion for all things AI. To scratch my itch for talking about things that interest me, I also teach statistics at the [Leiden University Psychology department](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/social-behavioural-sciences/psychology).

I live in The Hague, a city by the sea which currently houses the Dutch government but, interestingly, is not actually the capital. 

In my sparse spare time I enjoy programming, playing guitar and singing (in the shower and in bands), running and hiking.

My recent, shortened CV is available in English [here](docs/Curriculum_Vitae_en.pdf) and in Dutch [here](docs/Curriculum_Vitae_nl.pdf).
